GFXL is my work on graphics. I've got some linear algebra classes
as well as primitives and some GUI code, using SDL. I intend to
expand this work from time to time, making more useful libraries
designed for real-time graphics programming and demos. I'd like
to make some sort of engine, but who doesn't?

Use at your own risk; I test thoroughly for bugs, but I do not
guarantee this work is the best tool for the job and I have
implemented some esoteric things, like swizzling (don't get me
started; it was hard) and GLSL-like vector classes.
