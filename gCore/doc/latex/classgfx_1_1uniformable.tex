An interface for data types that can be uploaded as uniforms.  




{\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}g\-Core/g\-Scene/uniform.\-hpp\char`\"{}}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
An interface for data types that can be uploaded as uniforms. 

I am still trying to figure out a good way to deal with uniforms. This is one idea, though no code uses it yet and I am unsure if I want to do it this way. As mentioned elsewhere in \hyperlink{light_8hpp_source}{light.\-hpp}, I may expand the class system in datatype.\-hpp. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
g\-Scene/uniform.\-hpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
